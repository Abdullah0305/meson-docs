All the Testnet Tokens will be mapped to 1% of the Mainnet Tokens. according to FAQ-Token, there will be 100,000,000 initial Meson Tokens, of which there will be 1,000,000 Tokens are used as the exchange of Testnet Tokens.

**Your Mainnet Tokens = (Your Testnet Tokens / All Testnet Tokens) * (1% * All Mainnet Tokens) = (Your Testnet Tokens / All Testnet Tokens) * 1,000,000**

For example, let's assume there will be total 160,000,000 Testnet Tokens at last, and you have 2,000,000 Testnet Tokens that time, then you will get (2,000,000 / 160,000,000) * 1,000,000 = 125,000 Mainnet Tokens.
